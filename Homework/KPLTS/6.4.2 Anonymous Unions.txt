Chapter6 Structures
6.4 Unions: A Quick Look
6.4.2 Anonymous Unions
Anonymous unions work much the same as anonymous structures. That is, an anonymous
union is an unnamed member union of a structure or union. For instance, we can redefine the
car_data structure as follows:
struct owner {
	char socsecurity[12];
	...
};
struct leasecompany {
	char name[40];
	char headquarters[40];
	...
};
struct car_data {
	char make[15];
	int status; /* 0 = owned, 1 = leased */
union {
	struct owner owncar;
	struct leasecompany leasecar;
};
...
};

Now, if flits is a car_data structure, we can use flits.owncar.socsecurity instead of
flits.ownerinfo.owncar.socsecurity.
