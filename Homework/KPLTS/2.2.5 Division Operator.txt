2.2 Operators
2.2.5 Division Operator: /
C uses the / symbol to represent division. The value to the left of the / is divided by the value
to the right. For example, the following gives four the value of 4.0 :
four = 12.0/3.0;
Division works differently for integer types than it does for floating types. Floating-type division
gives a floating-point answer, but integer division yields an integer answer. An integer
canâ€™t have a fractional part, which makes dividing 5 by 3 awkward, because the answer does
have a fractional part. In C, any fraction resulting from integer division is discarded. This
process is called truncation .
