Chapter5 Pointers and Arrays
5.2 Arrays and Pointers
5.2.1 Using Pointer Parameters
A function working on an array needs to know where to start and stop. The sum() function
uses a pointer parameter to identify the beginning of the array and an integer parameter to
indicate how many elements to process. (The pointer parameter also identifies the type of data
in the array.) But this is not the only way to tell a function what it needs to know. Another
way to describe the array is by passing two pointers, with the first indicating where the array
starts (as before) and the second where the array ends.

#include <stdio.h>
#define SIZE 10
int sump(int * start, int * end);
int main(void)
{
	int marbles[SIZE] = {20,10,5,39,4,16,19,26,31,20};
	long answer;
	answer = sump(marbles, marbles + SIZE);
	printf("The total number of marbles is %ld.\n", answer);
	return 0;
}
/* use pointer arithmetic */
int sump(int * start, int * end)
{
	int total = 0;
	while (start < end)
	{
		total += *start; // add value to total
		start++; // advance pointer to next element
	}
	return total;
}
