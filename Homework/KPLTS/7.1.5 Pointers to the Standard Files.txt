Chapter7 Input and Output
7.1 Standard I/O
7.1.5 Pointers to the Standard Files
The stdio.h file associates three file pointers with the three standard files automatically
opened by C programs:
Standard File 	File Pointer 	Normally
Standard input 	stdin 		Your keyboard
Standard output stdout 		Your screen
Standard error 	stderr 		Your screen
These pointers are all type pointer-to- FILE , so they can be used as arguments to the standard
I/O functions, just as fp was in the example. Letâ€™s move on to an example that creates a new
file and writes to it.
