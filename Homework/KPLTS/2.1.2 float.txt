2.1.2 float
A floating-point number more or less corresponds to what mathematicians call a real number .
Real numbers include the numbers between the integers. Some floating-point numbers are
2.75, 3.16E7, 7.00, and 2eâ€“8. Notice that adding a decimal point makes a value a floating-point
value. So 7 is an integer type but 7.00 is a floating-point type. Obviously, there is more than
one way to write a floating-point number. We will discuss the e-notation more fully later,
but, in brief, the notation 3.16E7 means to multiply 3.16 by 10 to the 7th power; that is, by 1
followed by 7 zeros. The 7 would be termed the exponent of 10.
The key point here is that the scheme used to store a floating-point number is different from
the one used to store an integer. Floating-point representation involves breaking up a number
into a fractional part and an exponent part and storing the parts separately. Therefore, the
7.00 in this list would not be stored in the same manner as the integer 7, even though both
have the same value. The decimal analogy would be to write 7.0 as 0.7E1. Here, 0.7 is the fractional
part, and the 1 is the exponent part. Figure 3.3 shows another example of floating-point
storage. A computer, of course, would use binary numbers and powers of two instead of powers
of 10 for internal storage.
