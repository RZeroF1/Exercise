3.2.6 switch and if else
When should you use a switch and when should you use the if else construction? Often
you don’t have a choice. You can’t use a switch if your choice is based on evaluating a floating-
point variable or expression. Nor can you conveniently use a switch if a variable must fall
into a certain range. It is simple to write the following:

if (integer < 1000 && integer > 2)

Unhappily, covering this range with a switch would involve setting up case labels for each
integer from 3 to 999. However, if you can use a switch , your program often runs a little faster
and takes less code.
