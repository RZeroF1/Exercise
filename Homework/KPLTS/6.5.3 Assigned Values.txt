6.5 Enumerated Types
6.5.3 Assigned Values
You can choose the integer values that you want the constants to have. Just include the
desired values in the declaration:
enum levels {low = 100, medium = 500, high = 2000};
If you assign a value to one constant but not to the following constants, the following
constants will be numbered sequentially. For example, suppose you have this declaration:
enum feline {cat, lynx = 10, puma, tiger};
Then cat is 0 , by default, and lynx , puma , and tiger are 10 , 11 , and 12 , respectively.
