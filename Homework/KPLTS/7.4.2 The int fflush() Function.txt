7.4 Other Standard I/O Functions
7.4.2 The int fflush() Function
The prototype for fflush( ) is this:
int fflush(FILE *fp);
Calling the fflush() function causes any unwritten data in the output buffer to be sent to the
output file identified by fp. This process is called flushing a buffer. If fp is the null pointer, all
output buffers are flushed. The effect of using fflush() on an input stream is undefined. You
can use it with an update stream (any of the read-write modes), provided that the most recent
operation using the stream was not input.
