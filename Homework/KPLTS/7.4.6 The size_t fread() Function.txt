7.4.6 The size_t fread() Function
The prototype for fread() is this:
size_t fread(void * restrict ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb,
FILE * restrict fp);
The fread() function takes the same set of arguments that fwrite() does. This time ptr is
the address of the memory storage into which file data is read, and fp identifies the file to be
read. Use this function to read data that was written to a file using fwrite() . For example, to
recover the array of 10 doubles saved in the previous example, use this call:
double earnings[10];
fread(earnings, sizeof (double), 10, fp);
This call copies 10 size double values into the earnings array.
The fread() function returns the number of items successfully read. Normally, this equals
nmemb , but it can be less if there is a read error or if the end-of-file is reached.
