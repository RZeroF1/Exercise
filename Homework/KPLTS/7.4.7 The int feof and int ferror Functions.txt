7.4 Other Standard I/O Functions
7.4.7 The int feof(FILE *fp) and int ferror(FILE *fp) Functions
When the standard input functions return EOF , this usually means they have reached the end
of a file. However, it can also indicate that a read error has occurred. The feof() and ferror()
functions enable you to distinguish between the two possibilities. The feof() function returns
a nonzero value if the last input call detected the end-of-file, and it returns zero otherwise. The
ferror() function returns a nonzero value if a read or write error has occurred, and it returns
zero otherwise.
