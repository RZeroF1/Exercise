Chapter2 Type, Operation and Expressions
2.2 Operators
2.2.2 Addition Operator: +
The addition operator causes the two values on either side of it to be added together. For
example, the statement
printf("%d", 4 + 20);
causes the number 24 to be printed, not the expression
4 + 20.
The values (operands) to be added can be variables as well as constants. Therefore, the
statement
income = salary + bribes;
causes the computer to look up the values of the two variables on the right, add them, and
then assign this total to the variable income .
As a reminder, note that income , salary , and bribes all are modifiable lvalues because each
identifies a data object that could be assigned a value, but the expression salary + bribes is
an rvalue, a calculated value not identified with a particular memory location.
