4.3 Finding Addresses
4.3.2 The Indirection Operator *
Suppose you know that ptr points to bah , as shown here:
ptr = &bah;
Then you can use the indirection operator * (also called the dereferencing operator) to find the
value stored in bah (don’t confuse this unary indirection operator with the binary * operator of
multiplication—same symbol, different syntax):
val = *ptr; // finding the value ptr points to
The statements ptr = &bah; and val = *ptr; taken together amount to the following
statement:
val = bah;
Using the address and indirection operators is a rather indirect way of accomplishing this
result, hence the name “indirection operator.”
