Chapter7 Input and Output
7.1 Standard I/O
7.1.1 The fopen() Function
Next, the program uses fopen() to open the file. This function is declared in stdio.h . Its
first argument is the name of the file to be opened; more exactly, it is the address of a string
containing that name. The second argument is a string identifying the mode in which the file
is to be opened. The C library provides for several possibilities, as shown in Tableï¼š
Mode 	String Meaning
"r" 	Open a text file for reading.
"w" 	Open a text file for writing, truncating an existing file to zero length, or creating
	the file if it does not exist.
"a" 	Open a text file for writing, appending to the end of an existing file, or creating
	the file if it does not exist.
"r+" 	Open a text file for update (that is, for both reading and writing).
"w+" 	Open a text file for update (reading and writing), first truncating the file to
	zero length if it exists or creating the file if it does not exist.
"a+" 	Open a text file for update (reading and writing), appending to the end of an
	existing file, or creating the file if it does not yet exist; the whole file can be
	read, but writing can only be appended.
"rb" , 	Like the preceding modes, except they use binary mode instead of text mode.
"wb" , 
"ab" ,
"ab+" , 
"a+b" ,
"wb+" , 
"w+b" ,
"ab+" , 
"a+b"
"wx" , 	(C11) Like the non-x modes, except they fail if the file already exists and they
"wbx" ,	open a file in exclusive mode, if possible.

"wb+x" 
or
