Chapter1 A Tutorial Introduction
1.2Introducing C
1.2.1 The Structure of a Simple Program
A program consists of a collection of one or more functions, one of which must be
called main() . The description of a function consists of a header and a body. The function header
contains the function name along with information about the type of information passed to
the function and returned by the function. You can recognize a function name by the parentheses,
which may be empty. The body is enclosed by braces ( {} ) and consists of a series of
statements, each terminated by a semicolon (see Figure 2.4 ). The example in this chapter had
a declaration statement , announcing the name and type of variable being used. Then it had an
assignment statement giving the variable a value. Next, there were three print statements , each
calling the printf() function. The print statements are examples of function call statements .
Finally, main() ends with a return statement .
In short, a simple standard C program should use the following format:

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	statements
	return 0;
}
