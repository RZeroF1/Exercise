4.1 Functions
4.1.4 Calling a Function with an Argument: Actual Arguments
You give ch and num values by using actual arguments in the function call. Consider the first use
of show_n_char() :
show_n_char(SPACE, 12);
The actual arguments are the space character and 12 . These values are assigned to the corresponding
formal parameters in show_n_char() â€”the variables ch and num . In short, the formal
parameter is a variable in the called function, and the actual argument is the particular value
assigned to the function variable by the calling function. As the example shows, the actual
argument can be a constant, a variable, or an even more elaborate expression. Regardless of
which it is, the actual argument is evaluated, and its value is copied to the corresponding
formal parameter for the function. For instance, consider the final use of show_n_char() :
show_n_char(SPACE, (WIDTH - strlen(PLACE)) / 2);
The long expression forming the second actual argument is evaluated to 10 . Then the value
10 is assigned to the variable num . The function neither knows nor cares whether that number
came from a constant, a variable, or a more general expression. Once again, the actual argument
is a specific value that is assigned to the variable known as the formal parameter. Because the 
called function works with data copied from the calling function, theoriginal data in the calling 
function is protected from whatever manipulations the called function applies to the copies.
