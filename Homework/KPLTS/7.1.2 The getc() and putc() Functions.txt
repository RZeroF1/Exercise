Chapter7 Input and Output
7.1 Standard I/O
7.1.2 The getc() and putc() Functions
The two functions getc() and putc() work very much like getchar() and putchar() . The
difference is that you must tell these newcomers which file to use. So the following old standby
means “get a character from the standard input”:
ch = getchar();
However, this statement means “get a character from the file identified by fp ”:
ch = getc(fp);
Similarly, this statement means “put the character ch into the file identified by the FILE
pointer fpout ”:
putc(ch, fpout);
In the putc() argument list, the character comes first, and then the file pointer.
The example uses stdout for the second argument of putc() . It is defined in stdio.h as being
the file pointer associated with the standard output, so putc(ch,stdout) is the same as
putchar(ch) . Indeed, the latter function is normally defined as being the former. Similarly,
getchar() is defined as being getc() using the standard input.
You may wonder why this example uses putc() instead of putchar() . One reason is to introduce
the putc() function. The other is that you can easily convert this program to produce file
output by using an argument other than stdout.
