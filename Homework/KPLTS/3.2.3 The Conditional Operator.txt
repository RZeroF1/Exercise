3.2.3 The Conditional Operator: ?:
The following is the general form of the conditional expression:

expression1 ? expression2 : expression3

If expression1 is true (nonzero), the whole conditional expression has the same value as
expression2 . If expression1 is false (zero), the whole conditional expression has the same
value as expression3 .
You can use the conditional expression when you have a variable to which you want to assign
one of two possible values. A typical example is setting a variable equal to the maximum of two
values:
max = (a > b) ? a : b;
This sets max to a if it is greater than b , and to b otherwise.
Usually, an if else statement can accomplish the same thing as the conditional operator. The
conditional operator version, however, is more compact and, depending on the compiler, may
result in more compact program code.
