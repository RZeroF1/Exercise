This program enables you to add words to a file. By using the "a+" mode, the program can
both read and write in the file. The first time the program is used, it creates the wordy file and
enables you to place words in it, one word per line. When you use the program subsequently,
it enables you to add (append) words to the previous contents. The append mode only enables
you to add material to the end of the file, but the "a+" mode does enable you to read the
whole file. The rewind() command takes the program to the file beginning so that the final
while loop can print the file contents. Note that rewind() takes a file pointer argument.
