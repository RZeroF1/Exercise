6.1 Defining a Structure Variable
6.1.1 Initializing a Structure
You’ve seen how to initialize variables and arrays:
	int count = 0;
	int fibo[7] = {0,1,1,2,3,5,8};
Can a structure variable be initialized, too? Yes, it can. To initialize a structure (any storage
class for ANSI C and later, but excluding automatic variables for pre-ANSI C), you use a syntax
similar to that used for arrays:

struct book library = {
	"The Pious Pirate and the Devious Damsel",
	"Renee Vivotte",
	1.95
};

In short, you use a comma-separated list of initializers enclosed in braces. Each initializer
should match the type of the structure member being initialized. Therefore, you can initialize
the title member to a string and the value member to a number. To make the associations
more obvious, we gave each member its own line of initialization, but all the compiler needs
are commas to separate one member’s initialization from the next.
