6.5 Enumerated Types
6.5.1 enum Constants
Just what are blue and red ? Technically, they are type int constants. For example, given the
preceding enumeration declaration, you can try this:
printf("red = %d, orange = %d\n", red, orange);
Here is the output:
red = 0, orange = 1
What has happened is that red has become a named constant representing the integer 0.
Similarly, the other identifiers are named constants representing the integers 1 through 5.
You can use an enumerated constant anywhere you can use an integer constant. For example,
you can use them as sizes in array declarations, and you can use them as labels in a switch
statement.
