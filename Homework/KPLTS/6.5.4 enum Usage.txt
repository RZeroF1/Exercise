6.5 Enumerated Types
6.5.4 enum Usage
Recall that the purpose of enumerated types is to enhance a programâ€™s readability and make it
easier to maintain. If you are dealing with colors, using red and blue is much more obvious
than using 0 and 1 . Note that the enumerated types are for internal use. If you want to enter a
value of orange for color , you have to enter a 1 , not the word orange , or you can read in the
string "orange" and have the program convert it to the value orange .
Because the enumerated type is an integer type, enum variables can be used in expressions in
the same manner as integer variables. They make convenient labels for a case statement.
