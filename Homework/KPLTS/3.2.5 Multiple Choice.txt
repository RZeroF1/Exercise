3.2 C Control Statements: Branching and Jumps
3.2.5 Multiple Choice: switch and break
The expression in the parentheses following the word switch is evaluated. In this case, it has
whatever value you last entered for ch . Then the program scans the list of labels (here, case
'a' : , case 'b' : , and so on) until it finds one matching that value. The program then
jumps to that line. What if there is no match? If there is a line labeled default : , the 
program jumps there. Otherwise, the program proceeds to the statement following the switch.
What about the break statement? It causes the program to break out of the switch and skip to
the next statement after the switch.Without the break statement, every statement
from the matched label to the end of the switch would be processed.
