3.2 C Control Statements: Branching and Jumps
3.2.1 The if Statement
Letâ€™s start with a simple example of an if statement, shown. This program reads
in a list of daily low temperatures (in Celsius) and reports the total number of entries and the
percentage that were below freezing (that is, below zero degrees Celsius). It uses scanf() in a
loop to read in the values. Once during each loop cycle, it increments a counter to keep track
of the number of entries. An if statement identifies temperatures below freezing and keeps
track of the number of below-freezing days separately.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	const int FREEZING = 0;
	float temperature;
	int cold_days = 0;
	int all_days = 0;
	printf("Enter the list of daily low temperatures.\n");
	printf("Use Celsius, and enter q to quit.\n");
	while (scanf("%f", &temperature) == 1)
	{
		all_days++;
		if (temperature < FREEZING)
		cold_days++;
	}
	if (all_days != 0)
		printf("%d days total: %.1f%% were below freezing.\n",
			all_days, 100.0 * (float) cold_days / all_days);
	if (all_days == 0)
		printf("No data entered!\n");
	return 0;
}

Here is a sample run:
Enter the list of daily low temperatures.
Use Celsius, and enter q to quit.
12 5 -2.5 0 6 8 -3 -10 5 10 q
10 days total: 30.0% were below freezing.
