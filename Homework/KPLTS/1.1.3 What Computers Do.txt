1.1.3 What Computers Do
Modern computers have several components. The central processing unit , or CPU , does most
of the computing work. The random access memory , or RAM , serves as a workspace to hold

but now more and more often a solid-state device, remembers those programs and files, even
while the computer is turned off. And various peripherals—such as the keyboard, mouse,
touchscreen, and monitor—provide for communication between the computer and you. The
CPU processes your programs; so let’s concentrate on its role.
