The compiler can get confused. A true syntax error in one location might cause the
compiler to mistakenly think it has found other errors. For instance, because the example does
not declare n2 and n3 correctly, the compiler might think it has found further errors whenever
those variables are used. In fact, if you canâ€™t make sense of all the reported errors, rather than
trying to correct all the reported errors at once, you should correct just the first one or two and
then recompile; some of the other errors may go away. Continue in this way until the program
works. Another common compiler trick is reporting the error a line late. For instance, the
compiler may not deduce that a semicolon is missing until it tries to compile the next line. So
if the compiler complains of a missing semicolon on a line that has one, check the line before.
