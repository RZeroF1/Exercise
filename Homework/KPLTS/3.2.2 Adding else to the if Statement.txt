3.2 C Control Statements: Branching and Jumps
3.2.2 Adding else to the if Statement
	The simple form of an if statement gives you the choice of executing a statement (possibly
compound) or skipping it. C also enables you to choose between two statements by using the
if else form. Let’s use the if else form to fix an awkward segment.

if (all_days != 0)
	printf("%d days total: %.1f%% were below freezing.\n", all_days, 100.0 * (float) 	cold_days / all_days);
if (all_days == 0)
	printf("No data entered!\n");

If the program finds that all_days is not equal to 0 , it should know that days must be 0
without retesting, and it does. With if else , you can take advantage of that knowledge by
rewriting the fragment this way:

if (all_days!= 0)
	printf("%d days total: %.1f%% were below freezing.\n",all_days, 100.0 * (float) 		cold_days / all_days);
else
	printf("No data entered!\n");

Only one test is made. If the if test expression is true, the temperature data is printed. If it’s
false, the warning message is printed.
Note the general form of the if else statement:

if ( expression )
	statement1
else
	statement2
