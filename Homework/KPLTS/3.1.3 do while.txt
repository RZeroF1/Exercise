Chapter3 Control Flow
3.1 C Control Statements:Looping
3.1.3 do while
The while loop and the for loop are both entry-condition loops. The test condition is checked
before each iteration of the loop, so it is possible for the statements in the loop to never
execute. C also has an exit-condition loop, in which the condition is checked after each iteration
of the loop, guaranteeing that statements are executed at least once. This variety is called a
do while loop.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	const int secret_code = 13;
	int code_entered;
do{
	printf("To enter the triskaidekaphobia therapy club,\n");
	printf("please enter the secret code number: ");
	scanf("%d", &code_entered);
} while (code_entered != secret_code);
	printf("Congratulations! You are cured!\n");
	return 0;
}
The program reads input values until the user enters 13 . The following is a
sample run:
To enter the triskaidekaphobia therapy club,
please enter the secret code number: 12
To enter the triskaidekaphobia therapy club,
please enter the secret code number: 14
To enter the triskaidekaphobia therapy club,
please enter the secret code number: 13
Congratulations! You are cured!
