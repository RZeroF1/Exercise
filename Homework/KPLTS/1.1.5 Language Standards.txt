1.1.5 Language Standards
At first, there was no official standard for C. Instead, the first edition of The C Programming
Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (1978) became the accepted standard, usually
referred to as K&R C or Classic C . In particular, the “C Reference Manual” in that book’s appendix
acted as the guide to C implementations. Compilers, for example, would claim to offer a
full K&R implementation. However, although this appendix defined the C language, it did not
define the C library. More than most languages, C depends on its library, so there is need for a
library standard, too. In the absence of any official standard, the library supplied with the Unix
implementation became a factor standard.
