7.4 Other Standard I/O Functions
7.4.1 The int ungetc(int c, FILE *fp) Function
The int ungetc() function pushes the character specified by c back onto the input stream.
If you push a character onto the input stream, the next call to a standard input function reads
that character. Suppose, for example, that you want a function to read characters
up to, but not including, the next colon. You can use getchar() or getc() to read characters
until a colon is read and then use ungetc() to place the colon back in the input stream.
The ANSI C standard guarantees only one pushback at a time. If an implementation permits
you to push back several characters in a row, the input functions read them in the reversed
order of pushing.tpos().
