2.2 Operators
2.2.6 Modulus Operator: %
The modulus operator is used in integer arithmetic. It gives the remainder that results when the
integer to its left is divided by the integer to its right. For example, 13 % 5 (read as “13 modulo
5”) has the value 3, because 5 goes into 13 twice, with a remainder of 3. Don’t bother trying to
use this operator with floating-point numbers. It just won’t work.
At first glance, this operator might strike you as an esoteric tool for mathematicians, but it
is actually rather practical and helpful. One common use is to help you control the flow of a
program. Suppose, for example, you are working on a bill-preparing program designed to add in
an extra charge every third month. Just have the program evaluate the month number modulo
3 (that is, month % 3 ) and check to see whether the result is 0. If it is, the program adds in
the extra charge.
