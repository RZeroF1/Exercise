6.2 Arrays of Structures
6.2.2 Identifying Members of an Array of Structures
To identify members of an array of structures, you apply the same rule used for individual
structures: Follow the structure name with the dot operator and then with the member name.
Here’s an example:
library[0].value /* the value associated with the first array element */
library[4].title /* the title associated with the fifth array element */
Note that the array subscript is attached to library , not to the end of the name:
library.value[2] // WRONG
library[2].value // RIGHT
The reason library[2].value is used is that library[2] is the structure variable name, just
as library[1] is another structure variable name.
By the way, what do you suppose the following represents?
library[2].title[4]
It’s the fifth character in the title (the title[4] part) of the book described by the third structure
(the library[2] part). In the example, it would be the character B . This example points
out that subscripts found to the right of the dot operator apply to individual members, but
subscripts to the left of the dot operator apply to arrays of structures.
In summary, we have this sequence:
library // an array of book structures
library[2] // an array element, hence a book structure
library[2].title // a char array (the title member of library[2])
library[2].title[4] // a char in the title member array
