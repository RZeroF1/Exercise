Chapter2 Type, Operation and Expressions
2.1 Basic C Data Types
2.1.5 Signed or Unsigned?
Some C implementations make char a signed type. This means a char can hold values typically
in the range –128 through 127. Other implementations make char an unsigned type,
which provides a range of 0 through 255. Your compiler manual should tell you which type
your char is, or you can check the limits.h header file, discussed in the next chapter.
As of C90, C enabled you to use the keywords signed and unsigned with char . Then, regardless
of what your default char is, signed char would be signed, and unsigned char would
be unsigned. These versions of char are useful if you’re using the type to handle small integers.
For character use, just use the standard char type without modifiers.
