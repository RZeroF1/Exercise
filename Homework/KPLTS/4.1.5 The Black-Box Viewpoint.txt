4.1.5 The Black-Box Viewpoint
Taking a black-box viewpoint of show_n_char() , the input is the character to be displayed and
the number of spaces to be skipped. The resulting action is printing the character the specified
number of times. The input is communicated to the function via arguments. This information
is enough to tell you how to use the function in main() . Also, it serves as a design specification
for writing the function.
The fact that ch , num , and count are local variables private to the show_n_char() function is
an essential aspect of the black box approach. If you were to use variables with the same names
in main() , they would be separate, independent variables. That is, if main() had a count variable,
changing its value wouldnâ€™t change the value of count in show_n_char() , and vice versa.
What goes on inside the black box is hidden from the calling function.
