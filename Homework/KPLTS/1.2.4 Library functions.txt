Chapter1 A Tutorial Introduction
1.2Introducing C
1.2.4 Library functions
In order to stop repeating the implementation of common code, allowing programmers to improve development efficiency,
the C language standard specifies a set of functions, which are then implemented by different
These functions are then implemented by different compiler vendors according to the standard and made available to programmers.
These functions form a library of functions called the standard library.
library, and these functions are also called library functions. On top of that, some compiler vendors may extend the library with 
additional functions (which may not be supported by other compilers).
