C does have some faults. Often, as with people, faults and virtues are opposite sides of the
same feature. For example, we’ve mentioned that C’s freedom of expression also requires added
responsibility. C’s use of pointers (something you can look forward to learning about in this
book), in particular, means that you can make programming errors that are difficult to trace. As
one computer preliterate once commented, the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.
C’s conciseness, combined with its wealth of operators, make it possible to prepare code that is extremely difficult to follow. You aren’t compelled to write obscure code, but the opportunity
is there. After all, what other language has a yearly Obfuscated Code contest?
There are more virtues and, undoubtedly, a few more faults. Rather than delve further into the matter.
