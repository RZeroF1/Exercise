2.2 Operators
2.2.7 Increment and Decrement Operators: ++ and --
++ is a self-incrementing operator, which is further divided into pre++ and post++, and -- is a 
self-decrementing operator, which is also divided into pre-- and post--.
Pre-++

int a = 10;
int b = ++a;//++ operand is a, which is placed in front of a, that is, pre ++
printf("a=%d b=%d\n",a , b);

Calculation mnemonic: first +1, then use;
a was 10, first +1, after a became 11, and then use is assigned to b, b get also 11, so after 
the calculation technique, a and b are both
are 11, equivalent to code like this:
int a = 10;

b = a.
printf("a=%d b=%d\n",a , b);

Posterior ++
int a = 10;
int b = a++;//++ operand is a, which is placed after a, that is, post++
printf("a=%d b=%d\n",a , b);

Calculation mnemonic: use first, then +1
Same as --
