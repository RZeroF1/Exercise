Chapter2 Type, Operation and Expressions
2.1 Basic C Data Types
2.1.1 int
An integer is a number with no fractional part. In C, an integer is never written with a decimal
point. Examples are 2, â€“23, and 2456. Numbers such as 3.14, 0.22, and 2.000 are not integers.
Integers are stored as binary numbers. The integer 7, for example, is written 111 in binary.
Therefore, to store this number in an 8-bit byte, just set the first 5 bits to 0 and the last 3 bits to 1
