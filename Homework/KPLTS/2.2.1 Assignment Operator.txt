2.2 Operators
2.2.1 Assignment Operator: =
In C, the equal sign does not mean “equals.” Rather, it is a value-assigning operator. The
statement
bmw = 2002;
assigns the value 2002 to the variable named bmw . That is, the item to the left of the = sign is
the name of a variable, and the item on the right is the value assigned to the variable. The =
symbol is called the assignment operator . Again, don’t think of the line as saying, "bmw equals
2002 .” Instead, read it as “assign the value 2002 to the variable bmw .” The action goes from
right to left for this operator.
