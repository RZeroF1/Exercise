Chapter4 Functions and Program Structure
4.2 Recursion
4.2.3 Tail Recursion
In the simplest form of recursion, the recursive call is at the end of the function, just before the
return statement. This is called tail recursion , or end recursion , because the recursive call comes
at the end. Tail recursion is the simplest form because it acts like a loop.
