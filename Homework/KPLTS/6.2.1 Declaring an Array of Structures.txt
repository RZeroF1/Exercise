6.2 Arrays of Structures
6.2.1 Declaring an Array of Structures
Declaring an array of structures is like declaring any other kind of array. Hereâ€™s an example:
struct book library[MAXBKS];
This declares library to be an array with MAXBKS elements. Each element of this array is a
structure of book type. Thus, library[0] is one book structure, library[1] is a second book
structure, and so on.
