4.2.4 Recursion and Reversal
Now let’s look at a problem in which recursion’s ability to reverse order is handy. (This is a
case for which recursion is simpler than using a loop.) The problem is this: Write a function
that prints the binary equivalent of an integer. Binary notation represents numbers in terms of
powers of 2. Just as 234 in decimal means 2 × 10^2 + 3 × 10^1 + 4 × 10^0 , so 101 in binary means
1 × 2^2 + 0 × 2^1 + 1 × 2^0. Binary numbers use only the digits 0 and 1.You need a method, or algorithm. 
How can you, say, find the binary equivalent of 5? Well, odd
numbers must have a binary representation ending in 1. Even numbers end in 0, so you can
determine whether the last digit is a 1 or a 0 by evaluating 5 % 2 . If the result is 1, 5 is odd,
and the last digit is 1. In general, if n is a number, the final digit is n % 2 , so the first digit you
find is the last digit you want to print. This suggests using a recursive function in which n %
2 is calculated before the recursive call but in which it is printed after the recursive call. That
way, the first value calculated is the last value printed.
To get the next digit, divide the original number by 2. This is the binary equivalent of moving
the decimal point one place to the left so that you can examine the next binary digit. If this
value is even, the next binary digit is 0. If it is odd, the binary digit is 1. For example, 5/2 is
2 (integer division), so the next digit is 0. This gives 01 so far. Now repeat the process. Divide
2 by 2 to get 1. Evaluate 1 % 2 to get 1, so the next digit is 1. This gives 101. When do you
stop? You stop when the result of dividing by 2 is less than 2 because as long as it is 2 or
greater, there is one more binary digit. Each division by 2 lops off one more binary digit until
you reach the end. (If this seems confusing to you, try working through the decimal analogy.
The remainder of 628 divided by 10 is 8, so 8 is the last digit. Integer division by 10 yields 62,
and the remainder from dividing 62 by 10 is 2, so that’s the next digit, and so on.)
