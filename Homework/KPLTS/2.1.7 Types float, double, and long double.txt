Chapter2 Type, Operation and Expressions
2.1 Basic C Data Types
2.1.7 Types float, double, and long double
The various integer types serve well for most software development projects. However, financial
and mathematically oriented programs often make use of floating-point numbers. In C, such
numbers are called type float , double , or long double . They correspond to the real types
of FORTRAN and Pascal. The floating-point approach, as already mentioned, enables you to
represent a much greater range of numbers, including decimal fractions. Floating-point number
representation is similar to scientific notation , a system used by scientists to express very large
and very small numbers.
